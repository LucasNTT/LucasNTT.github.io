                                Hi, and welcome. My name is Guillaume P. Hérault, I’m almost 60, and I work in Human Resources at a bank. I’m not a mathematician. I’m not an academic researcher. Until recently, I had never even heard of Fourier transforms.<br /><br />
                                And yet, this website exists.<br /><br />
                                A decade ago, I stumbled across an article about the discovery of the largest known prime number—a Mersenne prime—thanks to a distributed computing project (<a href="https://www.mersenne.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIMPS</a>). That got me curious. How are such huge primes <i>actually</i> proven? That question led me into number theory, fast multiplication, and Fast Fourier Transforms.<br /><br />
                                I was intrigued, but also puzzled: these proofs rely on floating-point approximations? That didn’t sit right with me. I wondered if it might be possible to do the same entirely with integers.<br /><br />
                                So I dove in. I read hundreds of academic papers. Most of which were far above my head at first. And slowly, painfully, I started to understand a few things. I’ve gathered those documents in the <a href="library.html">Library</a> section of this site.<br /><br />
                                The result is LucasNTT, a project that brings together what I’ve learned. I decided to write and share what was missing at the begining of my journey: a set of accessible documents to explain the math and algorithms behind it all (FFT, NTT, fast multiplication, IBDWT) written for people like me: curious, motivated, but not trained mathematicians.<br /><br />
                                If I could make progress, perhaps others will find it accessible too.<br /><br />
                                Thanks for visiting and I hope you’ll enjoy exploring the site.<br />
